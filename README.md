# Color values graph for Unity

This graph is useful for shader debugging. It allows you to see values outside 0 .. 1 range and what kind of curve shape you're getting.

It uses Unity's post processing stack v2. Tested in Unity 2018.4 and 2019.2 with built in rendering pipeline and LWRP.

Doesn't work in VR or with HDRP.
